### [01](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/scaling-vue-with-nuxt-js/why-use-nuxt/). Why use Nuxt.js?

> **7 Problems you can avoid by using Nuxt.js for your next Vue app**
>
> Vue.js is a great choice as a framework for your application. But, there are a couple concerns youâ€™ll likely run into:
>
> - How do I combine and configure all my JavaScript & Vue libraries to work together effectively?
> - How do I structure my application code using best practices?
> - How do I make sure my application is properly indexed by search engines?
> - How do I optimize my Vue application for speed?
>
> These are some of the concerns that Sebastien and Alexandre Chopin set out to solve when they created Nuxt.js, a higher-level framework thatâ€™s built _on top of_ Vue to help you build production-ready Vue applications.
>
> I want to let you in 7 problems youâ€™re going to run into building a Vue app, and tell you how Nuxt solves them.

#### Problem #1: Building a production-ready Vue app from scratch is difficult

> Not only does Nuxt come preconfigured with Vuex, Vue Router, and Vue-Meta, but it sets your project up with intelligent defaults based on well researched best practices that Vue wonâ€™t give you out of the box.
>
> Creating a Nuxt app is as easy as typing: `$ npx create-nuxt-app <project-name>`
>
> The Nuxt Starter Kit will ask you for the libraries you want to start your project with, such as CSS Lint, and which CSS framework to use.

#### Problem #2: No standard folder structure

> As your application grows your code organization becomes more important. Vueâ€™s default build gives you an **assets** and **components** directory, which is a good start. Nuxt.js sets you up with additional folders based on best practices, such as:
>
> ðŸ“‚ A `pages` directory for your Application views and routes.
>
> ðŸ“‚ A `layouts` directory for your layout templates.
>
> ðŸ“‚ A `store` directory for your Vuex store files.
>
> Nuxt ships with more folders and more default conventions which are all configurable, but you get the idea.
>
> **Since everything has its place, moving from one Nuxt application to another as a developer and getting up to speed is super simple.**

#### Problem #3: Routing configuration can get long in a big Vue app

> With Nuxt, you simply place your single file Vue components into the pages folder and Nuxt automatically generates your routes with zero configuration.
>
> This is just one more example of how Nuxt gives you the pre-configuration you need to create production-ready Vue applications. This leads us to the next problem with big applicationsâ€¦

#### Problem #4: No standard way to configure things all together

> Luckily, **Nuxt ships with a production ready configuration that doesnâ€™t lock you in.** Meaning if you do you want to override any of the smart defaults or pre-configuration you can edit your nuxt.config.js file and modify any of the frameworkâ€™s options.

#### Problem #5: Vue apps are not SEO-friendly

> Youâ€™re going to want certain pages of your app properly indexed by search engines so theyâ€™re easily discoverable.
>
> One of the best solutions is to pre-render your Vue pages on the server, but this can be tricky to setup on your own. Nuxt is pre-configured to generate your application on the server, along with powering up your routes to make it easy to add SEO-related tags.

#### Problem #6: Vue applications on initial load can be slow

> With Nuxt.js if you choose to render your application universally or statically, the pre-rendered HTML causes your page to load faster in the browser. Once itâ€™s loaded, itâ€™ll start running as a normal SPA. Plus with automatic code-splitting itâ€™s only going to load the JavaScript needed to make the route function.
>
> This makes for the optimal user experience.

#### Problem #7: With a Vue app you may find it difficult to change the behavior of the framework

> When you are developing production-grade applications, at some point youâ€™ll need to change the behavior of the framework. Nuxt provides a **higher-order module system** that makes it easy to customize every aspect of Nuxt.

### Conclusion

> So there you have it, 7 problems that Nuxt solves for you. As you can see, **Nuxt.js allows you to spend less time on configuration, and more time solving problems and building awesome Vue apps.**
