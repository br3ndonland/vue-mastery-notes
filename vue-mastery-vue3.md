## 1. Why the Composition API

### Readability suffers as components grow

- Say you have searching and sorting features in a component. The search and sort features are split up across sections of the component (data, computed, methods, etc).
- **The composition API allows components to be organized by logical concerns.** All the search features can be collected together, and all the sorting features to be collected together. There's a new **`setup()` method** that accepts **composition functions**.
